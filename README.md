# Custom Dex

Simple Pokédex tool made by someone with basic knowledge of HTML/CSS, mostly made as a template for me to make future projects on but I'm happy to share the code with anyone who wants it.

## Things Here

### generator.py
(if you put a list of pokémon and their respective types, and run generator.py, it'll output stuff so you can easily generate a huge list of the pokémon in html! useful for saving time. in the future i might make this process a little smoother and more customizeable but for now it is what it is)

### index.html
Right now it's just the Paldea Pokédex, effectively serving as a tech demo. The icons are created by yours truly but you're welcome to use however you want. Some information may be inaccurate for the purpose of showing that this actually works.
