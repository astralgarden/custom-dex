# Custom Dex

Simple Pokédex tool made by someone with basic knowledge of HTML/CSS, mostly made as a template for me to make future projects on but I'm happy to share the code with anyone who wants it.

**Generator.py**
(if you put a list of pokémon and their respective types, and run generator.py, it'll output stuff so you can easily generate a huge list of the pokémon in html! useful for saving time. in the future i might make this process a little smoother and more customizeable but for now it is what it is)
